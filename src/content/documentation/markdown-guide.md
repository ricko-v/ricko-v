Welcome to the Markdown Guide! This tutorial will help you learn the basics of Markdown, a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.

## Table of Contents
1. [Headings](#headings)
2. [Paragraphs](#paragraphs)
3. [Lists](#lists)
4. [Links](#links)
5. [Images](#images)
6. [Code](#code)
7. [Blockquotes](#blockquotes)
8. [Tables](#tables)

## Headings
Headings are created using the `#` symbol. The number of `#` symbols at the beginning of the line indicates the heading level.

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
```

## Paragraphs
Paragraphs are created by writing text separated by one or more blank lines.

```markdown
This is a paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
```

## Lists
### Unordered Lists
Unordered lists are created using `-`, `*`, or `+`.

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 1
  - Subitem 2
```

### Ordered Lists
Ordered lists are created using numbers followed by a period.

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
   1. Subitem 1
   2. Subitem 2
```

## Links
Links are created using square brackets `[]` for the text and parentheses `()` for the URL.

```markdown
[GitHub](https://github.com)
```

## Images
Images are similar to links but start with an exclamation mark `!`.

```markdown
![Alt text](https://example.com/image.jpg)
```

## Code
### Inline Code
Inline code is created using backticks `` ` ``.

```markdown
Here is some `inline code`.
```

### Code Blocks
Code blocks are created using triple backticks ``` ``` ``` or indentation.

<pre>
```
This is a code block.
```
</pre>

## Blockquotes
Blockquotes are created using the `>` symbol.

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

## Tables
Tables are created using pipes `|` and hyphens `-`.

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data 1   |
| Row 2    | Data 2   |
```

That's it! You now know the basics of Markdown. Happy writing!
